_Audio Eraser_ is an AI-powered feature introduced with the **Samsung Galaxy S25 series** that enables users to remove unwanted background sounds from videos directly on their device. Leveraging advanced on-device AI, Audio Eraser can **identify and separate** up to six types of sounds—including _voices, music, wind, crowds, nature,_ and _general noise_—allowing users to selectively reduce or eliminate distracting audio elements while preserving the sounds they want to keep.

<br>
My primary contribution was the development of the **detection model** that identifies the type of sound prior to the separation process. This model was specifically designed to be **lightweight** and highly efficient for **on-device** deployment, ensuring **fast inference** without heavy computational demands.
