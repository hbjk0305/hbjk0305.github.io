_MPTI (Meet Persona Through AI)_ is a conversational AI project that enables users to **interact with movie characters** through chatbot services. The system features two distinct chatbots: MPTI_Sherlock, powered by DialoGPT, and MPTI_Ironman, built on GPT-2. Each chatbot is fine-tuned on dialogue datasets extracted from movie scripts to accurately replicate the personalities and speech patterns of the respective characters. Users can engage in natural conversations with these AI personas, experiencing immersive interactions that mimic the original characters. The project demonstrates the application of **large-scale pre-trained language models** for persona-driven dialogue generation and provides resources for training, inference, and further customization of character-based chatbots.
