abstract: >-
  Developed a GAN-based deep learning model for real-time speech bandwidth extension, converting wideband (WB) audio signals to super-wideband (SWB) to enhance speech clarity in wireless communication. The model achieved 30% MUSHRA score improvement over input signals and demonstrated robust generalization to unseen speakers and codec artifacts.
