    I am a sound AI researcher at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/" target="_blank">Samsung Research</a>, where I focus on on-device sound event detection, anomaly sound detection, and audio-visual source separation. 
    I developed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sixEkGyg2O8" target="_blank">Audio Eraser</a> for the Galaxy S25 series, and received the Samsung Research Awardâ€”an honor granted to researchers who have made significant contributions to the organization. 
    Also, I contibuted to a diagnosis system for Samsung home appliances by developing an <a href="https://youtu.be/opsje6mc7CM?si=cc-X_uY9Lbvhbbs9&t=729" target="_blank">Abnormal Sound Classification</a> model.
    My research interests include but are not limited to audio understanding, multimodal learning, efficient deep learning, and so on.
