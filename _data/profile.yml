  <p>
    I am a sound AI researcher at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/" target="_blank">Samsung Research</a>, where I focus on on-device sound classification, sound source separation, and audio-visual localization.
    My research interests include machine learning for audio and speech, as well as multimodal learning. 
    I have contributed to the development of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sixEkGyg2O8" target="_blank">Audio Eraser</a> for the Galaxy S25 series, which enables users to remove unwanted background sounds from videos, 
    and <a href="https://youtu.be/opsje6mc7CM?si=cc-X_uY9Lbvhbbs9&t=729" target="_blank">Anomaly Sound Detection</a> for home appliances, which diagnoses and alerts users to abnormal sounds in their devices.

    I earned my B.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Engineering from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Seoul National University</a>, graduating summa cum laude.
